/**
 * @mainpage Welcome to the JaRMoS documentation!
 * 
 * The JaRMoS framework enables to import and simulate reduced models from various sources. So far support for rbmatlab,
 * KerMor and rbMIT reduced models is present, where we can only import the rbMIT models that have previously been
 * published with the \ref rbappmit android application.
 * 
 * In order to simply get started, check out the following pages in that order:
 * - \subpage jarmos_download
 * - \subpage jarmos_setup
 * - \subpage jarmos_models
 * 
 * If you want to extend JaRMoS or include own models, it will be helpful to understand the overall structure.
 * The framework is separated into the following modules:
 * @li @ref jarmosbase
 * @li @ref jarmosa
 * @li @ref jarmospc
 * @li @ref jkermor
 * @li @ref jrb
 * 
 * Please refer to the \subpage licensing for copyright information.
